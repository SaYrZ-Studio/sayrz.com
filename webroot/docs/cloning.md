# How to Get DeployZ on Your Computer

Getting DeployZ on your computer is easy. Just follow these simple steps.

## What You Need First

- Git (free tool for downloading code)
- A GitHub account (optional, but nice to have so you can fork DeployZ (: )

## Simple Steps to Get the Code

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

2. **Go to where you want to save the project**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```

   git clone https://github.com/sayrzs/deployz.git
   ```

4. **Go into the project folder**:

   ```

That's it! The code is now on your computer.

## What Happens Next

After you have the code, you can:

- Install what the project needs: `npm install`
- Run the project: `npm start`
- Make changes to the code if you want

## If Something Goes Wrong
